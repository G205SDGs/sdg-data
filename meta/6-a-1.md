indicator_name: Amount of water- and sanitation-related official development assistance that is part of a government-coordinated spending plan

target_id: 6.a
target: By 2030, expand international cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes, including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies

indicator_definition: "The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) is a quantifiable measurement as a proxy for international cooperation and capacity development support in financial terms. It is essential to be able to assess ODA in proportion with how much of it is included in the government budget to gain a better understanding of whether donors are aligned with national governments while highlighting total water and sanitation ODA disbursements to developing countries over time."
