    value: '<br>• Number of victims per 100,000 inhabitants (V/100,000): Number of victims per 100,000 inhabitants, based on the population on 31 December of the previous year. Up to and including 2012, the data is based on the 1987 census (Federal Republic of Germany) and the population register as of 3 October 1990 (German Democratic Republic); for the years 2013 to 2023, it is based on the 2011 census, and from the 2024 onwards, it is based on the 2022 census.<br>• For victims recorded in the reporting year, the year in which the offence was committed may also be prior to the reporting year (initial statistics). Persons who were recorded as victims multiple times in the reporting year are counted multiple times accordingly.<br>• Due to methodological changes, data from 2017 onwards is only comparable with previous years to a limited extent. For further information, see ‘1. General information on the time series’ in the national metadata.'
