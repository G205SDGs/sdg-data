The integrated management of rivers and lakes in transboundary basin areas is organised in <a  href="https://www.bmuv.de/themen/wasser-und-binnengewaesser/fluesse-und-seen/flussgebietskommission" target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert('the BMUKN','En');">International River Basin Commissions</a>. The commissions' activities are based on international agreements. Germany is a member of eight international river basin commissions: the Rhine, Danube, Elbe, Oder, Meuse, Moselle, Saar and Lake Constance. This means that operational arrangements for water co-operation apply to 100 % of Germany's transboundary basin areas.
