# Nationale Metadaten
national_indicator_available: "Health workers, according to the practising concept (with direct patient contact): <br> Dentists <br> Nursing and midwifery personnel <br> Pharmacists <br> Medical doctors"
comparison_sdg: 'Traditionally, the indicator has been estimated using two measurements: density of physicians, and density of nursing and midwifery personnel. In the context of the SDG agenda, the dataset have been expanded to physicians, nursing personnel, midwifery personnel, dentistry personnel and pharmaceutical personnel. The dataset is planned to progressively move expand to cover all health cadres. As long as the international metadata description of the SDG indicator 3.c.1 is not completed, the time series "health workers" could not be considered as compliant. But the four additional time series are listed as sub-indicators in the international metadata description.'
