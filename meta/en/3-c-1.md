comparison_sdg: 'Traditionally, the time series has been estimated using two measurements: density of physicians, and density of nursing and midwifery personnel. In the context of the SDG agenda, the dataset has been expanded to physicians, nursing personnel, midwifery personnel, dentistry personnel and pharmaceutical personnel. The dataset is planned to progressively expand to cover all health cadres. As long as the global metadata of the SDG indicator 3.c.1 are not completed, the time series "health workers" can not be considered as compliant. The four additional time series are listed as sub-indicators in the global metadata.'
