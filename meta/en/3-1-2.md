# Nationale Metadaten
national_indicator_available: Live births in hospitals
comparison_sdg: 'The time series only reflects the SDG indicator 3.1.2 partly. Voluntarily reported data of home births do exist, but are not consistent with the data of the hospital statistics and the birth statistics of the Federal Statistical Office.
Additionally, the age of the mother is not limited from 15 to under 50 years of age according to the metadata description. Births of younger and older mothers are usually more risky than others. These mothers need skilled attendants in particular. Hence, the time series presented as indicator is not age-limited.'
