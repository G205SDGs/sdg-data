# Nationale Metadaten
national_indicator_available: 'Mortality rate of persons aged 30 to under 70 years attributed to; a) cardiovascular disease; b) cancer; c) diabetes mellitus; d) chronic respiratory disease'
comparison_sdg: The presented time series are not compliant with the (sub)-indicators described in the international metadata of the SDG indicator 3.4.1, because they only contain the number of persons died from the relevant diseases in a given age class whereas the SDG indicator should cover the probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years (by using life table methods). The probability is defined as the percentage of 30-year-old-people who would die before their 70th birthday from the mentioned diseases.
