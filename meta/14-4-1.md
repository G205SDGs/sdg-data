title: Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels
indicator_name: Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels

target_id: '14.4'
target: By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics

indicator_definition: The indicator Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels measures the sustainability of the world's marine capture fisheries by their abundance. A fish stock of which abundance is at or greater than the level, that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as biologically sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable.
